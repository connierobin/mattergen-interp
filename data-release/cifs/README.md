# Structures generated by MatterGen in Crystallographic Information File (CIF) format

This folder contains crystal structures presented in "MatterGen: a generative model for inorganic
materials design".

The top-level directories and their contents are as follows:

* [`unconditional`](unconditional): Unconditional generation results in Fig. 2.
* [`chemsys`](chemsys): Chemical-system-conditioned generation results in Fig. 3.
* [`single_prop`](single_prop): Single-property-guided generation results in Fig. 4.
* [`joint_mag_hhi`](joint_mag_hhi): Joint magnetic density and HHI-score-conditioned results in Fig. 5.
* [`experimental`](experimental): Generated structure that was experimentally synthesised in  Fig. 6, and its disordered version.
* [`symmetry`](symmetry): Symmetry-conditioned generation results in Fig. D8 of the supplementary information.
* [`alex-mp`](alex-mp): Alex-MP datasets used to train and fine-tune MatterGen.

In all subdirectories, two CIF files are included for each generated structure. `<reduced formula>.cif` contains the original structure after DFT relaxation; `<reduced formula>_symmetrized.cif` contains the structure saved with a relaxed symmetry tolerance `symprec=0.1`, which is the tolerance used in the paper to report the space group; otherwise default settings of `pymatgen==2023.12.18` and `spglib==2.0.2` were used.
